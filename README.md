# Power BI AdventureWorks Report

## Overview
This repository contains the complete end‑to‑end analytics pipeline I built for a fictional retail company as part of a Udemy Power BI course
that went through all key stages of the business intelligence workflow: data prep, data modeling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization & dashboard design.  

It demonstrates:
* Importing and cleaning raw CSV data with Power Query.  
* Modeling a star- and snowflake‑schema in Power BI.
* Writing DAX measures for revenue, profit margin, target profit, etc.
* Designing an interactive dashboard (maps, slicers, drill‑through pages).

## Key insights I discovered
1. Calculated KPIs (total revenue, total profit, total orders, and return rate).
2. Built line plot of total revenue trending.
3. Built cards showing monthly revenue, orders and returns and whether they met the desired target.
4. Built an interactive interface that allows filtering of all previous visualisations by year/month/week, product/product category.
5. Built an interactive map that allows seeing insights by individual region on a continental and national level.
6. Built a product detail dashboard that shows insights for whether a chosed product has met the individual target revenue.
7. Also built a customer detail dashboard that allows visualisation of the background of the customers of the company.

## What I learnt
- Using PowerQuery for data-type conversion, duplicate removal, and merging tables.
- Building star- and snowflake schema models and writing DAX measures.
- Designing interactive visuals (maps, drill-though line charts, bookmarks).

## How to explore the project
