# Power BI Capstone – XYZ Retail (Udemy Project)

## Overview
This repository contains the complete end‑to‑end analytics pipeline I built for a fictional retail company as part of a Udemy Power BI course.  
It demonstrates:

* Importing and cleaning raw CSV data with Power Query  
* Modeling a star- and snowflake‑schema in Power BI  
* Writing DAX measures for revenue, profit margin, target profit, etc.  
* Designing an interactive dashboard (maps, slicers, drill‑through pages)

## How to explore the project
1. Just download the file "AdventureWorks Report.pbix" and open it with PowerBI Desktop. Downloading the raw data files is optional.
